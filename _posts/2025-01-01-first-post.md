## Intro
I've always been interested in how games like Noita are able to have such beautiful physics interactions. Looking up the engine for the game hoping to understand how they've been able to design the game to behave this way. I found out that their engine is custom made! The Falling Everything engine they call it. Their very own custom built 2D pixel physics simulation engine. I became curious enough to design the foundations of this engine using only <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a>.
<br>
The physics used in this game is absolutely phenomenal, creating interactions between each pixel really elevates the experience when it all comes together. Nothing feels more satisfying then watching the world burn around a monster trapped in an oil pit as you set off an spark in there.
